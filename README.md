Original mod by: MormonPartyboat

Additional work by: Malkeus

Started off with Malkeus' work with the desire to make trees growable again.

Most of the work I did was around 2016-08-26, and it worked well, I've only done minimal work on getting it to load in experimental 0.C-22335-g620b23feab with no testing to speak of.
